# Geometry of Information Course
Lectured by: [Prof. Ariel Jaffe](https://arieljaffe.huji.ac.il/)

Technological developments have enabled the acquisition and storage of increasingly large-scale, high-resolution, and high-dimensional data in many fields. These datasets pose a challenge for classical methods relying on parametric modeling, statistical estimation or linear methods. However, it has been shown that many real-world data represented in high-dimension (audio, images, biological data etc.) lie on or near low-dimensional manifolds.

## Course Overview

This course tought me of advanced concepts in data analysis, emphasizing the geometric aspects of information representation and processing. Here's a brief overview of the topics covered:

1. **Linear Data Analysis**: Topics include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA).

2. **Kernel-Based Methods**: Understanding the kernel trick and its applications, including Kernel PCA.

3. **Spectral Graph Theory**: Exploring concepts related to spectral graph theory, including the Affinity and Laplacian matrices.

4. **Clustering Algorithms**: Learning about K-means and Spectral clustering techniques for data clustering tasks.

5. **Manifold Learning**: Understanding non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques and manifold learning approaches.

6. **Graph Signal Processing**: Exploring methods for processing signals defined on graphs.

7. **Representation Learning with Neural Networks**: Delving into representation learning using neural networks, including Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN).
